## hello, world!!!

### I'm in love with my car

I want to break free

1. Created an account on GitHub
2. Created a local repository
3. Made local and remote repositories friends. GitHub will tip how to do this 
4. Sent the local repository into remote(git push)
5. Made changes on GitHub 
6. Downloaded changes actual state from the remote repository(git pull)
